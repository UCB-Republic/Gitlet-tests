Usage
=====
This test system uses a simple format to specify tests.  The system compiles
the specification to Bash scripts and then run the scripts to do the actual
testing.

init
----
First, make sure the latest versions of `ruby` and `bash` (as of 2015-04-15)
are installed.  Then:
```
cd my/project/repo
git clone https://github.com/UCB-Republic/Gitlet-tests.git test
mkdir test/tests
```

compile tests
-------------
```
cd my/project/repo
cd test/tests
../generate-tests.rb
```

run tests
---------
```
../run-tests.bash
```
NOTE that `run-tests.bash` is generated by `generate-tests.rb`.  You need to
run `generate-tests.rb` first to get this file.
Also NOTE that the script assumes your program is located at
`my/project/repo/gitlet.jar`.

edit tests
----------
All tests are specified in `test-spec`.  See the comments (currently
Simplified Chinese) in the file.  After editing the tests, don't forget to
recompile them.
